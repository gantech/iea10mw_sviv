Case setup for forced motion simulations of IEA 10MW
----------------------------------------------------


This case setup is designed for reproducing results from Christian Grinderslev's paper in https://wes.copernicus.org/articles/7/2201/2022/

This will only work on the NREL Kestrel system as of the date of this commit 02/04/2025. No guarantees on this setup working later.

Steps to run this

1. From the top level folder `python utilities/gen_cases.py`
2. From the top level folder `sbatch run_openfast.slurm`
3. From the top level fodler `sbatch run_sviv.slurm`
